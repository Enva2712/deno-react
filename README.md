# Deno React

This is a super simple server that uses [es-react](https://github.com/lukejacksonn/es-react) to server render a react component within deno.

## Running

The only dependency is deno, but there's a Makefile to simplify building and running the code. If you're on a *nix system, just run `make run` to bundle and start the server

## Typescript?

It's not using typescript because I had trouble getting deno to run tsx. Still troubleshooting...
